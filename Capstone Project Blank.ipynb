    "Sentiment analysis is a machine learning-based technique used to analyze subjective reviews in a computer-understandable language. Our project aims to compare various ML models for performing sentiment analysis. We used an umbrella dataset that combined three popular datasets to increase the diversity of training and testing data. In this project notebook, we have designed and tested multiple supervised machine learning algorithms such as - Random Forest, Extra Tree Classifier, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and XG Boosting. Through our experiments, we were able to showcase how other algorithms report a better performance for the use cases we have presented. We also designed a Voting Classifier that uses a majority voting method to aggregate the results obtained by all the other models and combine them to report its prediction."

    "The notebook has been divided into 5 main catogories - Loading Datasets and Libraries, Dataset Processing, Visualization, Algorithms, and Results and Discussion. The client using the notebook to perform sentiment analysis is required to follow the steps in order to ensure proper functioning. The detailed information regarding each step is given as the notebook reads. The client is open to jump to any step for understanding purposes only. We highly recommend to run the cells in order for smooth functioning."

    "The program requires use of multiple libraries which need to be imported into your system for use. Therefore, client needs to open a terminal window and install the libraries not present in the system using. You can refer to the following packaging guide to understand the process of installing libraries - https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/\n",
